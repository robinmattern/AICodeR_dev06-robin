# App: c36_hawaii-contracts-app 
## Overview
I have asked three different models to summarize Hawaii contracts using the model provider's different interface with more still to come:

- website via browser 
- API end points via curl
- API end points via NodeJS
- NPM modules via NodeJS
- NPM modules via Electron App 
- Python packages via Cassandra
- Python packages via Google's Colab Juypter
- MaxAI extension via browser 
- AnythingLLM app via AIDocs 
- and many more 

Below are the Markdown sessions that I had with the three models:

- [24.1  Claude v3.5 Model via web ](Claude-35s_Anthropic-web/c36_c35sanw_t024.01.0.40706.1700_response.md)  
- [25.11 Gemini v1.5 Model via web ](Gemini-15_Google-web/c36_ge15ggw-t025.11.0.40706.1032_response.md)  
- [25.15 Gemini v1.5 Model via web ](Gemini-15_Google-web/c36_ge15ggw-t025.15.0.40706.1818_response.md)  
- [26.1  GPT    v4o  Model via curl](GPT-40_OpenAI-curl/c36_gp4oopu_t026.01.0.40707.1921_markdown.md)  

The full session's markdown files were more or less difficult to create --

- The Claude Session No. 24 was somewhat easy to create being able to copy each response. I had to create user's prompt manually
- The Bard / Gemini Sessions No. 25 was very difficult since only allow sharing the full session via the web or Google Docs. 
  It really was two sessions, the first one needing to be split up into three sets of messages 
  - [re creating the code to view charts](https://g.co/gemini/share/b08714978223)
  - [re getting data from the Hawaii website](https://g.co/gemini/share/b0699a8e22ff)

  <br>  
  
- The curl and NodeJS Sessions No. 26 will be very easy to create once I finish writing the scripts
