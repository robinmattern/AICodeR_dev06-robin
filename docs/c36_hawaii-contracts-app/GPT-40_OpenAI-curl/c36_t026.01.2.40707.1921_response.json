The data should ideally include: \n        - Name of the Awardee\n        - Date Awarded\n        - Original Award Amount\n        - Jurisdictions\n        - Category\n\n2. **Organize Data:**\n    - If the data is in a downloadable format (like CSV, Excel, or PDF), download it and open it using software like Excel, Google Sheets, or any other data processing tool.\n    - If the data needs to be manually copied, input the data into a new spreadsheet.\n\n3. **Aggregate Data by Category:**\n    - Create a pivot table or use a similar method to aggregate the data.\n    - Group all entries by the 'Category' column.\n    - Sum the 'Original Award Amount' for each category.\n\n4. **Prepare the Summary:**\n    - Organize the summarized data in a readable format, showing each category and the corresponding total amount awarded.\n\nHere is a simplified example assuming you have the data in an Excel spreadsheet:\n\n**Example Data:**\n| Awardee       | Date Awarded | Original Award Amount | Jurisdictions | Category      |\n|---------------|--------------|-----------------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Company A     | 01/01/2023   | $100,000              | Juris1        | Construction  |\n| Company B     | 01/15/2023   | $200,000              | Juris2        | IT Services   |\n| Company C     | 02/01/2023   | $150,000              | Juris1        | Construction  |\n| Company D     | 02/20/2023   | $300,000              | Juris3        | Healthcare    |\n| Company E     | 03/05/2023   | $250,000              | Juris2        | IT Services   |\n\n**Steps in Excel:**\n1. **Select your data range** and insert a pivot table (Insert > PivotTable).\n2. In the Pivot Table Fields, drag 'Category' to Rows and 'Original Award Amount' to Values.\n3. Ensure that the values are set to Sum to get the total amount.\n\n**Example Result:**\n| Category      | Total Awarded Amount |\n|---------------|----------------------|\n| Construction  | $250,000             |\n| IT Services   | $450,000             |\n| Healthcare    | $300,000             |\n\nIf you're using a coding approach (e.g., using Python and pandas), the process would involve reading the data into a DataFrame and using groupby and sum operations:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Read the data into a DataFrame\ndf = pd.read_csv('hawaii_awards.csv')\n\n# Group by category and sum the award amounts\ncategory_summary = df.groupby('Category')['Original Award Amount'].sum().reset_index()\n\n# Output the summary\nprint(category_summary)\n```\n\nThis script assumes you have the data saved in a CSV file named 'hawaii_awards.csv'.\n\nBy following these steps, you can obtain a summary of the total awarded amounts in each category."
