To provide a summary of the awards by category, I'll outline the steps you can take to gather and analyze the data:

1. **Access the Website and Obtain Data:**
    - Visit the website that lists all awards or contracts issued by the state of Hawaii.
    - Download or scrape the data available on the website. The data should ideally include: 
        - Name of the Awardee
        - Date Awarded
        - Original Award Amount
        - Jurisdictions
        - Category

2. **Organize Data:**
    - If the data is in a downloadable format (like CSV, Excel, or PDF), download it and open it using software like Excel, Google Sheets, or any other data processing tool.
    - If the data needs to be manually copied, input the data into a new spreadsheet.

3. **Aggregate Data by Category:**
    - Create a pivot table or use a similar method to aggregate the data.
    - Group all entries by the 'Category' column.
    - Sum the 'Original Award Amount' for each category.

4. **Prepare the Summary:**
    - Organize the summarized data in a readable format, showing each category and the corresponding total amount awarded.

Here is a simplified example assuming you have the data in an Excel spreadsheet:

**Example Data:**
| Awardee       | Date Awarded | Original Award Amount | Jurisdictions | Category      |
|---------------|--------------|-----------------------|---------------|---------------|
| Company A     | 01/01/2023   | $100,000              | Juris1        | Construction  |
| Company B     | 01/15/2023   | $200,000              | Juris2        | IT Services   |
| Company C     | 02/01/2023   | $150,000              | Juris1        | Construction  |
| Company D     | 02/20/2023   | $300,000              | Juris3        | Healthcare    |
| Company E     | 03/05/2023   | $250,000              | Juris2        | IT Services   |

**Steps in Excel:**
1. **Select your data range** and insert a pivot table (Insert > PivotTable).
2. In the Pivot Table Fields, drag 'Category' to Rows and 'Original Award Amount' to Values.
3. Ensure that the values are set to Sum to get the total amount.

**Example Result:**
| Category      | Total Awarded Amount |
|---------------|----------------------|
| Construction  | $250,000             |
| IT Services   | $450,000             |
| Healthcare    | $300,000             |

If you're using a coding approach (e.g., using Python and pandas), the process would involve reading the data into a DataFrame and using groupby and sum operations:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Read the data into a DataFrame
df = pd.read_csv('hawaii_awards.csv')

# Group by category and sum the award amounts
category_summary = df.groupby('Category')['Original Award Amount'].sum().reset_index()

# Output the summary
print(category_summary)
```

This script assumes you have the data saved in a CSV file named 'hawaii_awards.csv'.

By following these steps, you can obtain a summary of the total awarded amounts in each category.
