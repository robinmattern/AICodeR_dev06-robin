I apologize for the confusion. I wasn't able to actually create a visual chart in my previous response. 
Instead, I provided a Python script you can run on your computer after you install the necessary modules.. 

To create and view an actual chart, we would need to modify the code to generate a visual representation. 
I can help you with that. Let's create a simple bar chart using React to visualize the data.

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import { BarChart, Bar, XAxis, YAxis, CartesianGrid, Tooltip, Legend, ResponsiveContainer } from 'recharts';

const data = [
  { category: "Goods & Services", amount: 3940835.34 },
  { category: "Construction", amount: 3472431.63 },
  { category: "Professional Services", amount: 3021446.03 },
  { category: "Services", amount: 2148072.00 },
  { category: "Goods and Services", amount: 2065412.06 },
  { category: "Health and Human Services", amount: 0.00 }
];

const AwardSummaryChart = () => (
  <div style={{ width: '100%', height: 400 }}>
    <ResponsiveContainer>
      <BarChart data={data} margin={{ top: 20, right: 30, left: 20, bottom: 5 }}>
        <CartesianGrid strokeDasharray="3 3" />
        <XAxis dataKey="category" angle={-45} textAnchor="end" height={100} />
        <YAxis />
        <Tooltip formatter={(value) => `$${value.toLocaleString()}`} />
        <Legend />
        <Bar dataKey="amount" fill="#8884d8" name="Total Award Amount" />
      </BarChart>
    </ResponsiveContainer>
  </div>
);

export default AwardSummaryChart;

```

I've created a React component that renders a bar chart of the total award values by category. 
This chart should now be visible in the user interface. The chart shows:

1. Each category on the x-axis
2. The total award amount for each category on the y-axis
3. Bars representing the award amounts
4. A tooltip that shows the exact dollar amount when you hover over a bar

The chart visually represents the data we discussed earlier:

1. "Goods & Services" has the highest total, represented by the tallest bar.
2. "Construction" and "Professional Services" follow closely behind.
3. "Services" and "Goods and Services" are in the middle range.
4. "Health and Human Services" has no visible bar due to its $0 value.

This visual representation makes it easy to quickly compare the award totals across different categories. 
You can see at a glance which categories received the most funding.

Is there anything specific about the chart you'd like me to explain or modify?
