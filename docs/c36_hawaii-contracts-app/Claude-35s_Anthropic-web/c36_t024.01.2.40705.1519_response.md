I'd be happy to help you summarize the Hawaii state contract awards by category. 
However, I don't have direct access to the website you're referring to or its data. 
To provide an accurate summary, I would need you to share the specific data from the website. 

Here's what I can do:

1. If you can provide the data in a structured format (like a CSV file or a table), 
   I can analyze it and create the summary you're looking for.

2. Alternatively, if you can share a sample of the data or a link to the specific page, 
   I can guide you on how to extract and organize the information.

3. Once I have the data, I can create a summary showing the total awarded amount for each category.

Could you please provide the data or a link to the specific page where this information is available? 
Once I have that, I'll be able to assist you more effectively with your request.
