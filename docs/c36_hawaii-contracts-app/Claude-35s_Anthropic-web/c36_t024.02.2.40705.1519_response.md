Thank you for providing the URL. Unfortunately, I'm not able to directly access or browse websites. 
However, I can guide you on how to approach this task using the information from the website you've shared.

Since the data is on a live website, you'll need to manually collect the information or use a data 
scraping tool to gather it. Here's a step-by-step process you could follow:

1. Visit the website: https://hands.ehawaii.gov/hands/awards

2. Look for any search or filter options that allow you to view all awards or contracts.

3. For each award, note down the following information:
   - Category
   - Original Award Amount

4. Collect this data for a significant number of awards to get a representative sample.

5. Once you have collected the data, you can organize it in a spreadsheet with columns for "Category" and "Award Amount".

6. Use the spreadsheet's sum function to total the award amounts for each unique category.

If you're able to collect this data and share a sample or summary with me, I'd be happy to help you 
   analyze it further or create a more detailed summary. 

Alternatively, if the website offers any export functionality or if you have permission to use web s
craping tools, those could be more efficient methods for collecting large amounts of data.

Would you like me to provide more detailed instructions on how to manually collect and organize this data, 
or do you have any questions about this process?
