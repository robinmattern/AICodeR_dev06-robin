Thank you for mentioning that you have a spreadsheet exported from the website. That's great as it will make 
the analysis much easier. However, I don't actually see any spreadsheet or data in our conversation yet. 
To help you summarize the awards by category, I'll need you to share the spreadsheet data with me.

Here's what you can do:

1. If the spreadsheet isn't too large, you could copy and paste the relevant columns (especially the Category 
and Original Award Amount) directly into our conversation.

2. If it's a large dataset, you could provide a summary of the data, such as:
   - The total number of awards
   - A list of all the categories
   - A few sample rows to give me an idea of the data structure

3. Alternatively, if you've already calculated totals by category, you could share those results.

Once you provide the data or a summary, I'll be able to help you analyze it or verify your calculations. 
I can also guide you on how to perform the analysis yourself if you prefer.

Please go ahead and share the data or summary, and I'll be ready to assist you further!
